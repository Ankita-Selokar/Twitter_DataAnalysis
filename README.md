# Twitter_DataAnalysis

Twitter data analysis using Power BI involves several key steps to transform raw data into actionable insights. First, the Power Query Editor is utilized to clean and preprocess the data, removing duplicates and irrelevant fields, and handling missing values. Once the data is refined, I create visually appealing dashboards that showcase metrics like tweet engagement, sentiment analysis, and URL clicked. These dashboards provide an interactive platform for stakeholders to explore the data and derive meaningful conclusions from Twitter interactions.
